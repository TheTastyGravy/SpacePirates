# Going Critical
Going Critical is a co-op game where you play as a team of thieves escaping from a heist! To stay alive and escape, you must work together with your team to repair, refuel and maintain your ship. Succeed, and the bounty is yours!

Co-operation is key, this mission depends on the bond between you and your crewmates. Strategize with your friends and quickly respond to hull breaches, plasma fields and attacks from the fuzz in this chaotic and fast-paced party game.

This is our game for major production at aie. We made this game over the course of 4 months in Unity 2020.3.5f with the Universal Render Pipeline, Input System, and the FMOD Unity plugin.
