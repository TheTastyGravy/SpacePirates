1. Create a manager object with a TrackManager, AIManager, and EventManager
2. Create an empty object called "Ship", with PowerManager and HullManager
3. Create an empty object called "Room" as a child of the ship, with RoomManager, and a trigger volume containing the entire room
4. Create walls and floors and children of the room
5. Create empty game objects for hole positions, rotating as nessesary, and assign them to RoomManager
6. Create an instance of the OxygenDisplay prefab in the room, giving it a reference to the RoomManager
7. Add stations as children of room as desiered
8. Repeat steps 3-7 until all rooms are added
9. Place the camera on a pivot object to rotate around for turns
10. Go to the PowerManager and add each engine and reactor station to its arrays
11. Go to the HullManager and add rooms to the left, right, and front (not all rooms need to be assigned to a region, and a room can belong to multiple)
12. Go to the TrackManger and assign references to the left, right, and center engines, and the camera pivot (camera trans)
13. Setup the track on the TrackManager
14. Place Spawner prefabs in the ship, and set the player slot for each player. This is where players will be spawned


Possible Problems:
Ensure each RoomManager has at least 1 hole position and 1 hole prefab
Ensure the TrackManager has a enemy ship prefab to use for the ship passing event
Ensure the EventManager has an astroid prefab that has an AstroidLogic on it
